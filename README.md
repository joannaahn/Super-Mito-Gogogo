# Super-Mito-Gogogo
This program gives you the country, age and sex of a disease of interest from ancient mitochondrial DNA using Fasta and Metadata files from an ancient mtDNA database.

Super Mito is a general MSA tool that allows you to find metadata information of a disease from ancient Homo Sapien Mitochondrial DNA. Input the pathology of interest and output the sample ID, country, epoch age, sex and its DNA sequence.

**Quickly find answers for questions such as:** 

Which country does the disease appear in the most?
What is the common age of patients with the disease? 
Is the disease found mostly in males or females? 
 
To answer these questions, we construct a phylogenetic tree using the code in this repo. 
 
**Available diseases** 
Altered Brain pH/ sCDB patients 

**To add more diseases to the list:**

1. select a country and disease from ancient mtDNA database (https://amtdb.org/samples)
2. find a data source hyperlink to the publication of the disease description 
3. find the fasta file and metadata of said disease and downloaded
4. combine the sequence and metadata (ID)
5. use multi sequence alignment to visualise in a phylogenetic tree with the age and sex etc.

Thank you for your time.
